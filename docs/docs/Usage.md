# Usage

- If you don't like reading, just jump into the fully working [playground](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation/tree/v2/playground) project. All features are implemented there, and it's the basis for the e2e tests.
- We fully support Redux, MobX and other state management libraries. See the integration tests [here](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation/tree/v2/integration).
- Navigation is written with `TypeScript` and shipped with the type definitions alongside the transpiled JS code. To enjoy API autocompletion, use an IDE that supports it, like VSCode or Webstorm.
- Take a look at this excellent showcase app [JuneDomingo/movieapp](https://github.com/JuneDomingo/movieapp). (using v1 of React Native Navigation with redux).

## The Basics

### Navigation
```js
import { Navigation } from 'react-native-navigation';
```

### registerComponent(screenID, generator)
Every screen component in your app must be registered with a unique name. The component itself is a traditional React component extending `React.Component` or `React.PureComponent`. It can also be a HOC to provide context (or a Redux store). Analgous to ReactNative's `AppRegistry.registerComponent`.

```js
Navigation.registerComponent(`navigation.playground.WelcomeScreen`, () => WelcomeScreen);
```


### registerAppLaunchedListener(callback)
This event is called once the app is launched. It's where you will initialize the app with the layout you want, via the SetRoot command. This creates the native layout hierarchy, loading React components into the `component` by name. 

Afterwards, the app is ready for user interaction. (Common gotcha: Be sure not to run setRoot before registerAppLaunchedListener() has fired!)

```js
Navigation.events().registerAppLaunchedListener(() => {
  Navigation.setRoot({
    root: {
      component: {
        name: 'navigation.playground.WelcomeScreen'
      }
    }
  });
});
```

## Layout Examples

The possibilities of the RNN layout API are wide open in terms of what you can construct with it: stacks, tabs and drawers in many combinations.

You can compose arbitrary native layout hierarchies (although some weird edge cases may not be possible or produce errors). In such cases, open an issue so that we either fix it or warn in dev time.

For all possible layout types see [API](/api/README).


### Single page app with two side menus:

```js
Navigation.setRoot({
  root: {
    sideMenu: {
      left: {
        component: {
          name: 'navigation.playground.TextScreen',
          passProps: {
            text: 'This is a left side menu screen'
          }
        }
      },
      center: {
        component: {
          name: 'navigation.playground.WelcomeScreen'
        },
      },
      right: {
        component: {
          name: 'navigation.playground.TextScreen',
          passProps: {
            text: 'This is a right side menu screen'
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Tab based app (with passProps example):

```js
Navigation.setRoot({
  root: {
    bottomTabs: {
      children: [
        {
          component: {
            name: 'navigation.playground.TextScreen',
            passProps: {
              text: 'This is tab 1',
              myFunction: () => 'Hello from a function!',
            },
          },
        },
        {
          component: {
            name: 'navigation.playground.TextScreen',
            passProps: {
              text: 'This is tab 2',
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  }
});
```

### Stack based app (with options example, initialised with 2 screens):

```js
Navigation.setRoot({
  root: {
    stack: {
      options: {
        topBar: {
          hidden: true,
        },
      },
      children: [
        {
          component: {
            name: 'navigation.playground.TextScreen',
            passProps: {
              text: 'This is tab 1',
              myFunction: () => 'Hello from a function!',
            },
          },
        },
        {
          component: {
            name: 'navigation.playground.TextScreen',
            passProps: {
              text: 'This is tab 2',
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  }
});
```

## Navigating The Stack

For all commands see [API](/api/README).

### push
Push a new instance of a screen (component) on top of `this` screen's navigation stack.

```js
Navigation.push(this.props.componentId, {
  component: {
    name: 'navigation.playground.PushedScreen'
  }
});
```

### pop
Pop the top screen from `this` screen's navigation stack.

```js
Navigation.pop(this.props.componentId);
```

### showModal
Show a screen as a modal. (Note: not part of the stack)

```js
Navigation.showModal({
  component: {
    name: 'navigation.playground.ModalScreen'
  }
});
```
### dismissModal
Dismiss modal.

```js
Navigation.dismissModal(this.props.componentId);
```

## Screen Lifecycle

The `componentDidAppear` and `componentDidDisappear` functions are special React Native Navigation lifecycle callbacks that are called on the component when it appears and disappears. 

Similar to React's `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount`, what's different is that they represent whether the user can actually see the component in question -- and not just whether it's been mounted or not. Because of the way React Native Navigation optimizes performance, a component is actually `mounted` as soon as it's part of a layout -- but it is not always `visible` (for example, when another screen is `pushed` on top of it).

There are lots of use cases for these. For example: starting and stopping an animation while the component is shown on-screen.

> They are implemented by iOS's viewDidAppear/viewDidDisappear and Android's ViewTreeObserver visibility detection

To use them, simply implement them in your component like any other React lifecycle function:

```js
class LifecycleScreenExample extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      text: 'nothing yet'
    };
  }

  componentDidAppear() {
    this.setState({ text: 'componentDidAppear' });
  }

  componentDidDisappear() {
    alert('componentDidDisappear');
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    alert('componentWillUnmount');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.root}>
        <Text style={styles.h1}>{`Lifecycle Screen`}</Text>
	      <Text style={styles.h1}>{this.state.text}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
